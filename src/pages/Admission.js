                We welcome new admissions from Pre-Nursery to Class VIII for the
                upcoming academic session. At Shri Guru Nanak Doon Vale School,
                our admission process is simple, transparent, and designed to
                ensure a smooth transition for both students and parents.
                Parents are encouraged to visit the school campus and interact
                with our admission team to understand our academic approach,
                facilities, and co-curricular offerings. Admission is granted
                based on interaction with the child and seat availability in the
                respective class. Application forms are available at the school
                office during working hours. Required documents include the
                childâ€™s birth certificate, previous school records (if
                applicable), and passport-size photographs. Join one of the best
                schools in Dehradun and give your child the right start in a
                supportive, value-driven learning environment.
